# disasterManagement Simulations

## Adhoc Network Simulation

This simulates how an adhoc network operates. Given a source and a destination node, use broadcasts from the source node to find the destination node. The program outputs a list from the destination to the source once found.

## Usage

Compile the program using make all. Clean using make clean.
After compiling, use the test.sh file to generate average RREQ times for 250 nodes in a size 50 matrix with 5, 10, 20 channels.
